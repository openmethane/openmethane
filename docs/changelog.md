## openmethane v0.4.0 (2024-09-23)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- Move `scripts/cmaq_preprocess/upload-domains.py` from Bash to Python ([#48](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/48))

### üÜï Features

- Add archive script to copy the results fo the daily and monthly AWS workflows to S3

  This script is used to archive the daily and monthly outputs to AWS S3, in the case of both a successful
  run and a failure. The failed runs will use a prefix of `/failed/$DOMAIN_NAME/$EXECUTION_ID`,
  while the daily and monthly results are stored in `/results/$DOMAIN_NAME/daily/$YEAR/$MONTH/$DAY` and
  `/results/$DOMAIN_NAME/monthly/$YEAR/$MONTH`, respectively.

  These data can then be fetched from S3 and used for any local analysis or postmortems. ([#47](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/47))
- Add script which loads previous results of daily runs for the monthly run. ([#52](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/52))
- Move `scripts/archive.py` from Bash to Python, add more error handling, make it runnable when started from
  EventBridge. ([#53](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/53))
- Support loading observations from multiple input files using a glob.

  Adds new environment parameter, `TEMPLATE_DIR`, to set the directory containing the CMAQ template files
  and `OBS_FILE_GLOB` to enable override the path of the input observation file/s. ([#55](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/55))

### üéâ Improvements

- Removed a duplicate global entry for the start/end date of a simulation
  and unified how parameters are named throughout `fourdvar`. ([#54](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/54))
- Load previous MCIP data when loading from the archive.

  Added support for using fourdvar date identifiers in the CMAQ preprocessing directories.

  Removed an ununsed `diurnal` parameter from `fourdvar`. ([#57](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/57))
- Log chi squared and bias values during the cost function execution ([#59](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/59))
- Don't clean up data for failed runs to make runs easily restartable ([#60](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/60))
- Added bias correction step for CAMS data.

  Fixes shock caused by discontinuity between CAMS free-running model
  and TROPOMI data. 
  the bias_correct_cams script should be included in the monthly
  workflow. It probably isn't necessary for the daily workflow provided
  we use local enhancement as our alerts algorithm. ([#63](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/63))
- Added CMAQ gradient test

  This addes a test for the CMAQ adjoint using a simple cost function of
  the sum of squares of model concentrations. the test uses the same
  logic as test_grad_finite_diff but is limited to the steps between
  model input and model output, i.e tests a shorter loop. Provided the
  run_model and run_adjoint are numerical no-ops this *should* be a
  direct test of the cmaq adjoint. ([#67](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/67))
- Print logs to stdout when CMAQ fails. ([#68](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/68))
- Added destriping function for TROPOMI data ([#72](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/72))

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Update the prior file location for the docker target ([#46](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/46))
- Update `scripts/load_from_archive.py` to use an inclusive end date
  which is a convention used throughout this project. ([#56](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/56))

### üìö Improved Documentation

- Updated the diagrams for the `daily` workflow and added the `monthly` workflow. ([#58](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/58))

### üîß Trivial/Internal Changes

- [#64](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/64), [#66](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/66), [#68](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/68), [#69](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/69), [#73](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/73), [#74](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/74)


# ## openmethane v0.3.1 (2024-08-07)

No significant changes.


# ## openmethane v0.3.0 (2024-08-07)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- Merge `sat_data` and `obs_preprocess` script directories. ([#33](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/33))
- Moves to use a common set of environment variables throughout the repository. 
  This removes the cmaq_preprocess json files in preference to a .env file. 
  The `TARGET` environment variable is used to load the appropriate environment variable still.

  `setup_for_cmaq` now processes a single domain at a time which simplifies the whole process. 
  Running nested domains would likely require other changes throughout the codebase. 
  We now have a clean slate to add that feature if it was needed. ([#42](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/42))
- Migrates to use the `wrf` directory for the WRF outputs and domains. ([#45](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/45))

### üÜï Features

- Move prior domain generation to this repository from openmethane-prior.

  Adds scripts to upload the prior domains to the CloudFlare R2 bucket (requires credentials).
  The domains are uploaded with the naming convention of domains/{name}/{version}/prior_domain_{name}_{version}.d01.nc.
  These files can then be retrieved by `openmethane-prior` in the same fashion as the input data. ([#31](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/31))
- Adds a shell script for runnning tropomi ([#39](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/39))
- Adds towncrier to manage the changelog of the project.

  This is a tool that helps automate the process of updating the changelog.
  See the documentation for adding changelogs in `changes/README.md`.
  The changelog is updated by running `towncrier` which is done automatically on tagged releases.

  This PR also adds a GitHub action to automate the process of updating the changelog on tagged releases
  and for bumping new releases. ([#44](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/44))

### üéâ Improvements

- Remove unused cmaq preprocessing configuration values.

  Namely:

  * templateDir
  * sufadj
  * nhoursPerRun
  * printFreqHours
  * mechCMAQ
  * prepareRunScripts
  * add_qsnow
  * forceUpdateMcip
  * forceUpdateICandBC
  * forceUpdateRunScipts
  * doCompress
  * compressScript
  * cctmExec
  * scripts.cctmRun
  * scripts.cmaqRun

  This also removes the CMAQ run scripts as they were also unused in this particular application and required a bunch of extra configuration.

  The forceUpdateXXX parameters were combined into a single forceUpdate flag.

  ([#29](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/29))
- Add a parameter to specify the value of BTRIM,
  which is used to remove cells at the edge of the meteorology grid.

  For the full domain `5` is the default, 
  but for the 10x10 test grid this would leave no remaining cells so a value of 1 is used. ([#32](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/32))
- Refactor to use a common function for running subprocesses.

  This improves the logging of subprocesses and allows for easier debugging of issues. ([#41](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/41))
- Support the use of environment variables instead of command line arguments
  in `create_prior_domain.py`.

  Improved the flexibility of the upload domains script. ([#45](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/45))


## openmethane 0.2.0 (2024-07-09)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- Moves setup_for_cmaq script into the openmethane repo. 

  This aligns better with the other CMAQ preprocessing steps
  which are in this repo and are tightly coupled to the output from running setup_for_cmaq. ([#22](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/22))

- Refactor the scripts that are in the repository into the scripts directory. ([#11](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/11), [#15](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/15))

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Removed the hand-rolled logging implementation in preference for the standard logger.
  ([#6](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/6))

### üéâ Improvements

- Verify and document the new approach to running OpenMethane on GADI.
  
  See `docs/nci.md` for more information about the required steps. ([#28](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/28))

- Add an end-to-end test for running OpenMethane (`scripts/run-all.sh`).
  ([#25](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/25))

- Images that are built and pass the testsuite are pushed to ECR for use by the AWS workflow.
  ([#21](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/21))


- Dockerize the project and run via CI

  ([#10](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/10), [#18](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/18))

- Use the `TARGET` environment to specify the configuration used.

  Adds the concept of targets, defined using the `TARGET` env variable and the .env.${TARGET}` file.
  The parameters that can be stored in this file are located in `docs/parameters.md`.
  ([#7](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/7))

- Add tests to capture/track the state of the fourdvar parameters

  ([#5](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/10), [#18](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/5))

## openmethane 0.1.0 (2024-08-01)

Initial state of the OpenMethane repository.
