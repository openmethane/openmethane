## openmethane 0.2.0 (2024-07-09)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- Moves setup_for_cmaq script into the openmethane repo. 

  This aligns better with the other CMAQ preprocessing steps
  which are in this repo and are tightly coupled to the output from running setup_for_cmaq. ([#22](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/22))

- Refactor the scripts that are in the repository into the scripts directory. ([#11](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/11), [#15](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/15))

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Removed the hand-rolled logging implementation in preference for the standard logger.
  ([#6](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/6))

### üéâ Improvements

- Verify and document the new approach to running OpenMethane on GADI.
  
  See `docs/nci.md` for more information about the required steps. ([#28](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/28))

- Add an end-to-end test for running OpenMethane (`scripts/run-all.sh`).
  ([#25](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/25))

- Images that are built and pass the testsuite are pushed to ECR for use by the AWS workflow.
  ([#21](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/21))


- Dockerize the project and run via CI

  ([#10](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/10), [#18](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/18))

- Use the `TARGET` environment to specify the configuration used.

  Adds the concept of targets, defined using the `TARGET` env variable and the .env.${TARGET}` file.
  The parameters that can be stored in this file are located in `docs/parameters.md`.
  ([#7](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/7))

- Add tests to capture/track the state of the fourdvar parameters

  ([#5](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/10), [#18](https://github.com/openmethane/openmethane/pulls/5))
