Added CMAQ gradient test

This addes a test for the CMAQ adjoint using a simple cost function of
the sum of squares of model concentrations. the test uses the same
logic as test_grad_finite_diff but is limited to the steps between
model input and model output, i.e tests a shorter loop. Provided the
run_model and run_adjoint are numerical no-ops this *should* be a
direct test of the cmaq adjoint.
