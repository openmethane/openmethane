Added bias correction step for CAMS data.

Fixes shock caused by discontinuity between CAMS free-running model
and TROPOMI data. 
the bias_correct_cams script should be included in the monthly
workflow. It probably isn't necessary for the daily workflow provided
we use local enhancement as our alerts algorithm.
