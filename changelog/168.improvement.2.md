Fix errors and inconsistencies in CF attributes and variables:
- replace integer grid cell coordinates in `x` and `y` with grid projection coordinates
- remove `lat_bounds` and `lon_bounds` from output in favour of `x_bounds` and `y_bounds`
- fix and add required CF attributes such as `history` and `Conventions`
