Move prior domain generation to this repository from openmethane-prior.

Adds scripts to upload the prior domains to the CloudFlare R2 bucket (requires credentials).
The domains are uploaded with the naming convention of domains/{name}/{version}/prior_domain_{name}_{version}.d01.nc.
These files can then be retrieved by `openmethane-prior` in the same fashion as the input data.
