Update Dockerfile to use base image based on openmethane/CMAQ

If using the Dockerfile, no manual changes should be necessary. If running
locally or in an environment that doesn't support docker, CMAQ will need
to be provided in such a way that all CMAQ tools (MCIP, BCON, ICON) are built
into a single location, specified in CMAQ_BIN.

See https://github.com/openmethane/CMAQ Dockerfile for an example of how to
configure and build CMAQ binaries into a single location like /opt/cmaq/bin.
