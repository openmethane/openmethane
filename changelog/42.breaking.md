Moves to use a common set of environment variables throughout the repository. 
This removes the cmaq_preprocess json files in preference to a .env file. 
The `TARGET` environment variable is used to load the appropriate environment variable still.

`setup_for_cmaq` now processes a single domain at a time which simplifies the whole process. 
Running nested domains would likely require other changes throughout the codebase. 
We now have a clean slate to add that feature if it was needed.
