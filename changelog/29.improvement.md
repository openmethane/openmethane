Remove unused cmaq preprocessing configuration values.

Namely:

* templateDir
* sufadj
* nhoursPerRun
* printFreqHours
* mechCMAQ
* prepareRunScripts
* add_qsnow
* forceUpdateMcip
* forceUpdateICandBC
* forceUpdateRunScipts
* doCompress
* compressScript
* cctmExec
* scripts.cctmRun
* scripts.cmaqRun

This also removes the CMAQ run scripts as they were also unused in this particular application and required a bunch of extra configuration.

The forceUpdateXXX parameters were combined into a single forceUpdate flag.
