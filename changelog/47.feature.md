Add archive script to copy the results fo the daily and monthly AWS workflows to S3

This script is used to archive the daily and monthly outputs to AWS S3, in the case of both a successful
run and a failure. The failed runs will use a prefix of `/failed/$DOMAIN_NAME/$EXECUTION_ID`,
while the daily and monthly results are stored in `/results/$DOMAIN_NAME/daily/$YEAR/$MONTH/$DAY` and
`/results/$DOMAIN_NAME/monthly/$YEAR/$MONTH`, respectively.

These data can then be fetched from S3 and used for any local analysis or postmortems.
